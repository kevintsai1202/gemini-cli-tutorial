# Welcome to Gemini CLI documentation

Copy as MarkdownCopied!

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to installing, using, and
developing Gemini CLI. This tool lets you interact with Gemini models through a
command-line interface.

## Overview

[Section titled “Overview”](https://geminicli.com/docs/#overview)

Gemini CLI brings the capabilities of Gemini models to your terminal in an
interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) environment. Gemini CLI consists of a
client-side application (`packages/cli`) that communicates with a local server
(`packages/core`), which in turn manages requests to the Gemini API and its AI
models. Gemini CLI also contains a variety of tools for tasks such as performing
file system operations, running shells, and web fetching, which are managed by
`packages/core`.
