# Trusted Folders

Copy as MarkdownCopied!

The Trusted Folders feature is a security setting that gives you control over
which projects can use the full capabilities of the Gemini CLI. It prevents
potentially malicious code from running by asking you to approve a folder before
the CLI loads any project-specific configurations from it.

## Enabling the Feature

[Section titled “Enabling the Feature”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/trusted-folders/#enabling-the-feature)

The Trusted Folders feature is **disabled by default**. To use it, you must
first enable it in your settings.

Add the following to your user `settings.json` file:

```
{

  "security": {

    "folderTrust": {

      "enabled": true

    }

  }

}
```

## How It Works: The Trust Dialog

[Section titled “How It Works: The Trust Dialog”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/trusted-folders/#how-it-works-the-trust-dialog)

Once the feature is enabled, the first time you run the Gemini CLI from a
folder, a dialog will automatically appear, prompting you to make a choice:

- **Trust folder**: Grants full trust to the current folder (e.g.,
`my-project`).
- **Trust parent folder**: Grants trust to the parent directory (e.g.,
`safe-projects`), which automatically trusts all of its subdirectories as
well. This is useful if you keep all your safe projects in one place.
- **Don’t trust**: Marks the folder as untrusted. The CLI will operate in a
restricted “safe mode.”

Your choice is saved in a central file (`~/.gemini/trustedFolders.json`), so you
will only be asked once per folder.

## Why Trust Matters: The Impact of an Untrusted Workspace

[Section titled “Why Trust Matters: The Impact of an Untrusted Workspace”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/trusted-folders/#why-trust-matters-the-impact-of-an-untrusted-workspace)

When a folder is **untrusted**, the Gemini CLI runs in a restricted “safe mode”
to protect you. In this mode, the following features are disabled:

1. **Workspace Settings are Ignored**: The CLI will **not** load the
`.gemini/settings.json` file from the project. This prevents the loading of
custom tools and other potentially dangerous configurations.

2. **Environment Variables are Ignored**: The CLI will **not** load any `.env`
files from the project.

3. **Extension Management is Restricted**: You **cannot install, update, or**
**uninstall** extensions.

4. **Tool Auto-Acceptance is Disabled**: You will always be prompted before any
tool is run, even if you have auto-acceptance enabled globally.

5. **Automatic Memory Loading is Disabled**: The CLI will not automatically
load files into context from directories specified in local settings.

6. **MCP Servers Do Not Connect**: The CLI will not attempt to connect to any
[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://geminicli.com/docs/tools/mcp-server) servers.

7. **Custom Commands are Not Loaded**: The CLI will not load any custom
commands from .toml files, including both project-specific and global user
commands.


Granting trust to a folder unlocks the full functionality of the Gemini CLI for
that workspace.

## Managing Your Trust Settings

[Section titled “Managing Your Trust Settings”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/trusted-folders/#managing-your-trust-settings)

If you need to change a decision or see all your settings, you have a couple of
options:

- **Change the Current Folder’s Trust**: Run the `/permissions` command from
within the CLI. This will bring up the same interactive dialog, allowing you
to change the trust level for the current folder.

- **View All Trust Rules**: To see a complete list of all your trusted and
untrusted folder rules, you can inspect the contents of the
`~/.gemini/trustedFolders.json` file in your home directory.


## The Trust Check Process (Advanced)

[Section titled “The Trust Check Process (Advanced)”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/trusted-folders/#the-trust-check-process-advanced)

For advanced users, it’s helpful to know the exact order of operations for how
trust is determined:

1. **IDE Trust Signal**: If you are using the
[IDE Integration](https://geminicli.com/docs/ide-integration), the CLI first asks the IDE
if the workspace is trusted. The IDE’s response takes highest priority.

2. **Local Trust File**: If the IDE is not connected, the CLI checks the
central `~/.gemini/trustedFolders.json` file.
